                <h2>Kashmir - The jannat of world...</h2>
                <img src="kshm.jpg" class="rounded float-end" style="width:370px; height:250px; margin-bottom:25px; margin-left: 50px;">
                <p>Jammu & Kashmir is the northern most state of India and is also known as the crown of India. Due to the impeccable natural beauty Kashmir is called the <b>Paradise on Earth.</b> Despite the occasional political disturbances,this marvelous state is a treat to the eye.The Kashmiri people at large have a wonderfully welcoming aura which immediately makes you feel safe and welcomed as you enter this valley.Kashmir still remains one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in India. Kashmir has everything to offer to a nature-lover, from snow-capped mountains,to gushing streams,to lakes and lush green gardens, Kashmir has it all. Kashmir throughout the year looks beautiful and impressive. But winters in Kashmir is an experience of another kind. Some places in Kashmir Valley witness snowfall in winters and the entire snow-clad mountains of Pir Panjal makes winters the best time to visit Kashmir. January to March is the best time to enjoy the winter beauty of Kashmir. During this time you will be able to find enough snow in places like Gulmarg and Sonmarg. In spite of the chilling weather,this experience is indeed my warmest.

          <br><br><br>
          <h2>The kashmir - (A tourist place of india.)</h2>
          <img src="kshm2.jpg" class="rounded float-start" style="width:370px; height:250px; margin-right: 60px; margin-bottom:25px;">
           

                <h5>1) Gulmarg : </h5> Srinagar to Gulmarg is a 2 hours journey and so it is usually a full day trip to Gulmarg. Gulmarg boats of being a beautiful town surrounded by snow covered mountains,lush green meadows. Gulmarg is my personal favorite,as even in March this place was covered with snow,enough snow for me to build my own snowman. When visiting Gulmarg you must definitely try the famous gondala ride. Gulmarg Gondola is world's highest operating cable car. The price of the ticket is Rs. 740 for phase-1 ( Gulmarg to Kungdoor) and Rs.950 for Phase-2 (Kungdoor from Aparwath). The view from the Gondola is absolutely breathtaking,from that height it appears as if someone has painted the entire valley with white paint. Srinagar to Gulmarg is a 2 hours journey and so it is usually a full day trip to Gulmarg.
      <br><br><br><br>

                <h5>2) Sonmarg :</h5> Sonmarg valley which means the 'meadows of Gold' is about 80 kms from Srinagar and it is the second most visited place in Kashmir after Gulmarg. Some places to visit in Sonmarg are the Baltal Valley,the Zoji La pass,and Kheer Bhawani temple. The Zoji La pass is situated on the National Highway that connects Srinagar to Leh. There are a number of dhabas and shops on the highway where you can have some delicious food and the best maggi of your life.

      <br><br>
                <h5>3) Pahalgam :</h5> The most visited place in Pahalgam is the Betaab Valley, which was named after the Bollywood movie Betaab as the shooting of the movie was done here. Pahalgam serves as the starting point for the annual pilgrimage to the Amarnath cave in the months of July and August. Other places to see in Pahalgam are Tulian lake and Aru village and Pahalgam Golf course.
      <br><br>
                
                <h5>4) Dal Lake :</h5> Dal is a lake in Srinagar and is also known as Srinagar's jewel. A trip to Kashmir is incomplete without a Shikara boat ride in Dal Lake. In December and January as the temperature drops to minus, the Dal Lake freezes. But in March you will be able to enjoy the shikara ride. Dal Lake is the most popular landmark of Srinagar. Dal Lake is also like a floating market,as there are a number of Shikara shops. You may also choose to stay in a Houseboat. Houseboats are well-furnished and offer a beautiful view of the Dal Lake. Both deluxe and budget houseboats are available.
      <br><br>

                <h5>5) Gardens in Kashmir : </h5>We know that constructing gardens was the favorite pastime of Mughal emperors. This can be witnessed in Kashmir. Kashmir is known for the lush green Mughal gardens which are also known as Baghs. The six most beautiful Mughal gardens in Kashmir are : Nishat Bagh,Shalimar Bagh,Achabal Garden, Chashma Shahi,Pari Mahal,Verinag Garden. If time is a constraint then you can visit only Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh.

      <br><br>
                <h5>6) Temples and Mosque in Kashmir :</h5> <b>(i) Avantiswami temple-</b> The temple ruins is a heritage site and is located on the way from Srinagar to Pahalgam.
                  <br><br>
                      <b>(ii) Kheer Bhawani Temple :</b> Kheer bhawani temple is dedicated to worship of Goddess Ragnya Devi,and is constructed over a scared spring.The spring is said to change its color,it is believed that if the color of the spring changes to black which is considered as an ill-omen as it will lead to a disaster in the valley. The temple gets its unique name from the Indian dessert Kheer which is the main offering to the goddess.
                  <br><br>
                      <b>(iii) Hazratbal Mosque :</b> Hazratbal mosque is situated on the western banks on Dal Lake. It is a beautiful structure of white marble and an interesting fact about this mosque which makes it special is that it is the only domed mosque in Srinagar. The mosque offers a spectacular view of lake and mountain.
                  <br><br>
                 I hope this blog has already given you an idea about how beautiful and enchanting Kashmir is in winters. Winter is undoubtedly the best time to visit Kashmir. If you are someone who cannot tolerate extreme cold then you can plan a trip in mid-March as the weather remains pleasant. Winter in Kashmir is really special.Nothing in the world looks prettier than places like Gulmarg,Sonmarg and Pahalgam,all covered with a white blanket of snow. From snow-clad mountains,to frozen Dal Lake,to Pine trees partially covered with snow,everything will make your trip to Kashmir an experience of a lifetime. Jammu and Kashmir is not just a state it India,it is an experience. And as the tagline of J&K tourism says "Chalo Kashmir",so go and witness the paradise on Earth.

                <h2>SIKKIM – Where Nature Smiles.</h2>
                <img src="skkm2.jpg" class="rounded float-end" style="width:370px; height:250px; margin-bottom:25px; margin-left: 50px;">
                <p>Sikkim situated in the Eastern Himalayan region with an area of 7,096 sq km and altitude ranging from 300m to 8,586m above sea level is a wonderland blessed with natural abundance from icy cold deserts, flowering alpine meadows, to lush green forests and emerald mountain lakes. The crowning glory of this wonderland is undoubtedly the magnificent Mt. Khangchendzonga (8,586m), the third highest mountain of the world. The mountain is not merely a physical entity but the abode of guardian deity whose benign watchfulness ensures peace and prosperity of the land.

                    It is possible to move from the sub-tropical heat of the lower valleys to the cold of the rugged mountain slopes that ascend up to the areas of perpetual snow in a matter of few hours. Such a steep rise in altitude over a very short distance, allows the land to host a robust natural heritage and wealth. The snow-capped mountain ranges, lush thick forests, plunging mountain valleys flush with rich flora and fauna, picture perfect villages, groves of rhododendrons, hot –springs, waterfalls, perennial streams and grand rivers Teesta and Rangit all contribute to shape Sikkim as a magical, mystical wonderland.

                    Keeping in tune with the natural diversity, Sikkim has an equally rich and diverse demographic structure with myriad of communities and religions and intricately knit colourful cultures, the basic connecting factor being the warm, welcoming nature of the people everywhere. The phrase “Atithi Devo Bhava” finds its true meaning in Sikkim. Diverse rituals, songs, dances, traditional dresses, folklores and legends fill up the cultural canvas of the State. The chimes of bells in the temples and the flutter of prayer flags in the monasteries create a feeling of righteousness and healing of spirit and soul. Feel rejuvenated, energised and spirituality enlightened in this holy land.

                    Nature is revealed in its entire splendour in the serene lakes, cascading rivers and pristine waterfalls. Sacred lakes, waterfalls and hot water springs dot the mountainous landscape. Sikkim has a spectacular diversity of natural habitats and wildlife within a small geographic area of just 7,096 Sq. Km. From the river valleys and verdant forests to alpine meadows with rainbow of flowers blooming in monsoon; to the ice barren high glaciers and cold deserts – the vistas are endless and captivating for a visitor who is taken aback by such splendour.

                <p>One of the holiest pilgrimages in north India, Kedarnath is situated in Uttarakhand. It is located at an altitude of 3,584 m above sea level, near the head of river Mandakini. A popular destination for Hindu pilgrims, Kedarnath is one of the four major sites in India’s Chota Char Dham pilgrimage that also includes Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.

                It is the most remote of the four Char Dham sites and is flanked by breathtaking snow-clad peaks.

          <br>
            The shrine is submerged in snow for about half a year when the Lord is shifted to Ukhimath. According to a legend, the temple came into existence as a result of the Pandavas’ search for Lord Shiva to atone for their sins for killing their brethren during the Kurukshetra war. Lord Shiva avoided all attempts to meet the brothers and stopped at Kedarnath and took the form of a bull and started to force himself into the ground, leaving only his hump visible. The willpower and determination of the Pandavas impressed Lord Shiva and he forgave their sins, blessed them and allowed them to worship him at Kedarnath. It is said that the stone-like structure that is worshiped here is the hump of the bull.

            The arms appeared at the Tungnath Temple, the face at Rudranath Temple, the belly at Madmaheshwar Temple and his locks (hair) with head at Kalpeshwar Temple. Kedarnath and the four above mentioned shrines are treated as Panch Kedar.

                <p>Shah Jahan was the fifth ruler of the Mughal Dynasty. During his third regnal year, his favorite wife, known as Mumtaz Mahal, died due to complications arising from the birth of their fourteenth child.  Deeply saddened, the emperor started planning the construction of a suitable, permanent resting place for his beloved wife almost immediately. The result of his efforts and resources was the creation of what was called the Luminous Tomb in contemporary Mughal texts and is what the world knows today as the Taj Mahal.
                In general terms, Sunni Muslims favor a simple burial, under an open sky.  But notable domed mausolea for Mughals (as well as for other Central Asian rulers) were built prior to Shah Jahan’s rule, so in this regard, the Taj is not unique. The Taj is, however, exceptional for its monumental scale, stunning gardens, lavish ornamentation, and its overt use of white marble.

                          The plans for the complex have been attributed to various architects of the period, though the chief architect was probably Ustad Aḥmad Lahawrī, an Indian of Persian descent. The five principal elements of the complex—main gateway, garden, mosque, jawāb (literally “answer”; a building mirroring the mosque), and mausoleum (including its four minarets)—were conceived and designed as a unified entity according to the tenets of Mughal building practice, which allowed no subsequent addition or alteration. Building commenced about 1632. More than 20,000 workers were employed from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe to complete the mausoleum itself by about 1638–39; the adjunct buildings were finished by 1643, and decoration work continued until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42-acre (17-hectare) complex spanned 22 years.

                          A tradition relates that Shah Jahān originally intended to build another mausoleum across the river to house his own remains. That structure was to have been constructed of black marble, and it was to have been connected by a bridge to the Taj Mahal. He was deposed in 1658 by his son Aurangzeb, however, and was imprisoned for the rest of his life in Agra Fort.
